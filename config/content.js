Main issue I wanted to ‚fix’ was overcrowded view - in first few seconds I spend in the service I am already disoriented as there are many elements shouting at me at once. Many movies listed in too many various categories, images in the background, a lot of copy. I have no idea what to focus my sight on.',

After testers feedback I tried to simplify the website as much as possible. A few of testers made me realise that the same movie being seen in different categories can be really confusing.',
